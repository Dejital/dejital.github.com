<p>The following are songs that I've written and recorded.</p>

<ul>
{% for model in site.music %}
    <li><a href="{{ model.url }}">{{ model.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>Honestly this page just serves as an experiment in using <a href="https://github.com/krazykylep/Jekyll-Models">JekyllModels</a>.</p>
