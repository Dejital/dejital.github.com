            <p>
                Two hearts from vastly different backgrounds blend together in a culturally beautiful way.
                Sharmi was born in India and Serge was born in Russia.
                They met for the first time in the United States.
                Since then they have been inseparable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two practice and respect one another's traditions and customs.
                Living in Kansas City far from their extended families can be difficult, but their great love holds them firmly together.
                They share trusting friends and warm families that wish them well in their journey.
                They share a love for food, eating a unique blend of Indian and Russian cuisine that can only be their own.
                A globally diverse taste in films, music and arts makes every evening together uniquely special.
                Their respect for the birthplace of their love makes for great nights out on the town in Kansas City.
                This month they are in Chennai, introducing Serge to Sharmi's rich culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our wish is that you will share these special days with them in celebration of their bond.
