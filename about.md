## About

I was born in Russia and moved to Kansas City as a child. I began
making websites at age seven for myself, ranging from artwork to 
webcomics to games, and hosting them on Geocities. I took an interest in
user experience, web design and graphics.

In college I studied Mathematics, French and Philosophy. 
In that time I gained a love for `unix` and spent the
majority of my time in the terminal, writing essays in `LaTeX`, emails
in `mutt` and maintaining schoolwork with `git`.

In my career I worked at local startups and small companies. I enjoy 
working at a fast pace, on a small team, and in full stack development. 
I am passionate about building high quality products with great user
experiences.

I subscribe to the [Manifesto for Agile Software
Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/), Clean Code, YAGNI and SOLID
design principles. I favor custom solutions over common patterns and 
practices.

In my free time I like to work on side projects, play stringed
instruments, snap photographs and spend time with my
wife, friends and family.
