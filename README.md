## Backlog

There are a few things I would like to add:

- Display images inside of cards, subsequently add for Photographs 
  and Doodles card.
- More natural navigation back to home page and the blog.
- About Me page with more specific bio.
- Dedicated Music page with links to my own songs, as well as The Former 
  and Harlan Ray.
- List of my favorite albums.
- Dedicated Artwork page with more than just my outdated Tumblr content.
- Dedicated page for Resume, with web version of it. Not sure if that's
  really necessary.
