title: The perfect notebook system to get things done
---

I accidentally invented the single best system to keep a pocket notebook.
It turns out it's really not so difficult at all. In fact, it turns 
out that a system isn't even necessary.

Recently many [journal systems](http://bulletjournal.com/) began popping 
up online. I know several people who picked one and tried it out.
Eventually they grew tired and moved on. It didn't take very long 
either. **Why didn't it stick?**

These systems *look* beautiful. They aren't difficult to understand. 
They're easy to implement. They're very, very tempting. But they don't 
stick.

I've used a pocket notebook to keep track of tasks for a long time. 
I didn't start by researching existing systems either. I simply started.

**The single best system to keep a notebook is to eliminate the system.**
Define a loose set of rules, then let your mind wander.

My notebook looks like this.

It's small and it fits in my pocket. I can carry it around and never 
feel burdened.

I tend to keep each day to two pages. I lay out my tasks on the left 
and do whatever else on the right. 

I check off tasks when they're complete. Sometimes I even prioritize tasks, as above.

Other times it's barely legible. But it'll make sense in that 
day. Packing lists are perfectly suited.

I still haven't found an app for my iPhone to track workouts with as 
much freedom as a notebook does. 

Empty space is opportune for drawings...

...and half-baked concept album ideas.

**Do yourself a favor and pick up a pocket notebook.** You can write and track anything 
you want without any cumbersome interface or system around it.

The perfect system is right there in your pocket, and it doesn't need 
its battery charged.
