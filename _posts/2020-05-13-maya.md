title: Newborn daughter

Our daughter Maya was born just in time for lunch on April 25, 2020 at 11:55 AM. ðŸ‘¶

We are now happily enjoying her adorable facial expressions, her hilarious sounds that remind us of a squeaky door, and arguing over who she looks most like.

I know it would be impossible to convey the instant bonding that took place at birth to myself just weeks ago. The effect is astounding. All credits go to human nature.

Everyone is happy and healthy. Now we are working through learning this absolutely new mode of life. It can be exhausting, but it's constant pleasure. And we remain thankful for all the moments.
