title: Moments between the minutes
---

I learned to play guitar in the moments between the minutes.

I did not look for a teacher. I did not sit down to deliberately practice. I did not keep my guitar in its case.

I kept the guitar by my side. I reached for it when my computer was rebooting, a file was downloading, a video was buffering, or code was building.

These moments added up to days, weeks and months. Years later I play with confidence and pride.

I didn't need lessons like my guitar didn't need its case. It was always ready.

Make it stupid easy to get started and you won't be able to procrastinate. Forget the guitar case. Eliminate barriers to entry and keep tools ready at your side.

Become a pro without even trying. It just takes a few moments between the minutes.
