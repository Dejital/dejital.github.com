## Museum

I built many small websites as a little kid, hosted across Geocities, Angelfire and Tripod. 
Unfortunately most of these are lost to time, but some are preserved here in the Museum.

### [The Adventures of Bayou Billy](https://snevsky.com/museum/bayou-billy/index.shtml)

The [Gamespy Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpy) (formerly owned by IGN) once gave away free web hosting to video game fan sites.
I wanted free web hosting, but I didn't actually want to run a fan site. 
I submitted this fan site for an old obscure Nintendo Entertainment System game and was actually approved for the free hosting.
It features the classic HTML table-based layout popular in the late 90s.
